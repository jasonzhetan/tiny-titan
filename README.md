## Your Job

Your job is to display some board games based on a single search term. Use board game geek’s XML2 API to search for all board games that match the search term “hello”. Parse the results and display them in an appealing and accessible way. The UI part is up to your interpretation, but start with something basic like tiles of words.

You may use any package available via yarn. Tailwind and Typescript are pre-installed.
